                <p>DESPITE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE POWER THAT THE WEB ASSUMES TODAY, THE TRUTH IS THAT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN BOTH THIS WORLD-WIDE WEALTH OF INFORMATION AND THE COMPUTER AS A MEDIUM WERE SEEN AS OBJECTS OF A PROMISING FUTURE.

                <p>THE EXPECTATION OF THE WEB AND THE COMPUTER TO BECOME SPACES NOT ONLY FOR LEARNING AND COMMUNICATING, BUT ALSO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROBLEMS, EVENTUALLY CAME TO BE SUCCEEDED BY THE REALITY THAT, DESPITE ALL THESE QUALITIES BEING TRUE, THERE IS A DEEP AND COMPEX DIMENSION THAT IS MURKY AND OBSCURE TO THE UNSUSPECTING USER, LEADING TO SEE THE WORLD AS AN EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY.

                    <p>Demonstrations have had an important place in new media innovation. On the stage was Douglas Engelbart, with a huge projection screen behind him, and back in were most of the crew of their Augmentation Research Center (ARC). The demonstration was a huge, calculated risk.They took the risk because they believed in the power of the system they were planning to show.</p>

                    <p> Computer interfaces should be optimized for expert use and could require an up-front investment to learn. ARC’s research slowed, and the project was eventually to a commercial company. The new goals led instead to the “user friendly” systems at which most of us spend our days—systems designed to be optimal for a first-time user, rather than a skilled worker.</p>

                    <p>Apart from being a place of communication and learning, and a new market place, the Web is a show ground for new developments. The incredible diversity of information available points to a very exciting future. The power of the Web is evident today. It demonstrates that the technologies that prevail don’t have to be the best ones—they just have to be good enough.</p>

                    <p>The development of full Artificial Intelligence (AI) could spell the end of the human race. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn’t compete and would be superseded. The belief that human intelligence can be formalized and reproduced by machines has been axiomatic since the mid-twentieth century.

Mug shots of a woman are shared on the internet for researchers who would like to test their facial recognition software.
